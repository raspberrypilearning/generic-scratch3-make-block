### Making a block with parameters

+ You can also create blocks that have 'gaps' for adding data. These 'gaps' are called 'parameters'. To add parameters, first make a new block, and then click on the options below to choose the type of data you want to add. Then give your data a name, and click **OK**.

+ You will see a new `define` block as usual, except that this one contains the data gap you added and which you gave a name.

+ You can then use your new block, filling in data in the gap.
